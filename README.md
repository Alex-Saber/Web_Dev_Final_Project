# Web_Dev_Final_Project

ATAC was created by Alex Saber, Trung Nguyen, and Angelic Phan in a Full Stack Web Development class (CS 465P) taught by Caternia Paun. Our site offers a variety of games: Flappy Bird, Snake, and Space Invaders!. Users may either play without an account, or create one in order to keep track of your personal highscores.
